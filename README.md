# PHP_Loops

Create one php file with the 4 parts. Each part should do the following:

The 1st part of the script implements a while loop that displays odd numbers between 1 and 15. 
The 2nd part of the script implements a for loop to display numbers between 10 and 20
The 3rd  part of the script   includes the following variable declaration: $sales = 5000;
Using if/elseif/else statement determine the bonus percent. Make sure to change the value of $sales to fully test the script.
            If sales is between 2000 and 3000, the percentage to calculate the bonus is .10

            If sales is between 3001 and 4000, the percentage to calculate the bonus is .20

            If sales is greater than 4000, the percentage to calculate the bonus is .30

            Anything else gets a 0 for the bonus percentage

The 4th  part of the script  uses  a switch statement  that compares the contents the variable $city to the case labels. If a match if found, the city’s sate is echoed to the screen and a break statement ends the switch statement. For instance, start with $city = ‘Boston’. Make sure to change the city to fully test your script.
